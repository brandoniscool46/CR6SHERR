# CR6SHERR
Simple program that makes videos for crashing someone's Discord client.
Please note that the videos may not crash recent desktop client versions of Discord these days, but it should do its job on some older versions.

#### WORKING AT IT

# Dependencies:
The only dependency is FFmpeg (can be downloaded by CR6SHERR if it is not installed)

# Versions
1.  Command Line format (Batch) - lightweight, powerful, makes you a hacker

2.  User-friendly GUI format - for the ones not familiar with the terminal, more easy-to-use (will work on it once i finish the batch format)
